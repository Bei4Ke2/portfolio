                        <p>I am a designer who aspires to bring change through intuitive designs and delightful
                            experiences. The process
                            of problem-solving has always been intuitive to me, and I am energized by the difficulties
                            problems present.
                            Over the years, I have had the opportunity to work in different industries and partake in
                            unique roles, and
                            I believe my diverse experience has made me a humble person who is equipped with skills that
                            are crucial
                            for a designer. As an effective communicator and an empathetic problem solver, I’m passionate
                            about speaking
                            the user’s language and creating solutions that address the user's pain points. My background
                            in economics
                            and management consulting has taught me the importance of business goals and key drivers of
                            success,
                            allowing me to achieve harmony by building products with both user and company goals in mind.
    
                            <br><br> How did I get here?
                            <br><br> Starting at the age of 12, I became aware of my interests and appreciation for
                            well-designed computer
                            games. I have always loved learning about various game models and experiencing a variety of
                            game journeys
                            and interface/dashboard designs. I did not think much of it at the time while my parents were
                            not exactly
                            the encouraging type when it came to gaming. Time flew, and life went on. It wasn't until much
                            later
                            when I thought about how a game is a well-thought-out product that heavily employs all aspects
                            of experience
                            design and how incredible it would be to be part of designing an enjoyable experience for
                            people.
                            <br><br>
                            During my free time, I like to dance, snowboard, work on jigsaw puzzles, play computer games,
                            and volunteer
                            at CoachArt where I teach children how to hip-hop dance.
                            <br><br>
                            I look forward to joining a team that will lead
                            and shape the future of experience design.
